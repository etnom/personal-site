Serendipity is a place for musically aspiring Bay Area artists to practice, hone, and challenge their capabilities in a wide-ranging environment equipped to cater to both collaborative interaction and individual experimentation. Serendipity will not only be a gathering place for those to express themselves through sound but will also be a place to learn and draw from musical history. Capitalizing on the site's public waterfront access, a public performace space is a key component of Serendipity.",
