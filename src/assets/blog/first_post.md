# Introduction

I never really considered starting a blog or anything until [I saw one of my friends start one](https://astrid.tech/blog/) and I was like "huh that's pretty cool, maybe I can give that a shot" and well here we are. I also wanted to try out [this dope Markdown editor in VSCode](https://github.com/yzhang-gh/vscode-markdown) and after writing these first two sentenences I can't believed I used to write raw Markdown like a primitive. 

Anyways so like here's my blog! Nothing super official or anything, I'll just post random stuff occasionally, or like never, we'll see. I already built a very similar project for [my company](http://suild.com/) so I figured it wouldn't be too tough to get something together for my website too. Well I'm actually writing this before all the fancy blog stuff is even done yet so maybe it is harder than expected, and if so you probably won't be reading this anyways. 

# Motivation

As you can probably tell, this is just super casual just to share my thoughts on random stuff. Writing regular English is actually pretty fun and while taking a philisophy class, I sort of realized how much I come to miss it. It's a nice break from sweaty STEM classes all day and now in college, I don't always have the opportunity to dedicate tons of effort to the humanities as I did in high school. I only get like one GE/humanities class per quarter from now on, as opposed to high school where I'd be taking 2-3 humanities classes simultaneously and I guess now I'm starting to appreciate those opportunies I had in high school a lot more. 

I also think it's cool that all my work is sort of like a time capsule too, with tangible records as opposed to my memory which may not be as permenant and consistent. I read somewhere that memories are actually some sequence of neurons firing off and everytime we recollect a memory, that sequence actually gets mutated a bit, and so does that memory. Basically, the more we recollect a memory, the less true that memory becomes. I'm not a scientist or anything so don't quote me on that, but the preservation of I guess myself and my ideas is something that I value a bit but don't get to excercise too much. 

Come to think of it, it's not common that I genuinely express my ideas and thoughts that can be captured in their entirety. When I write for school for example, my ideas get filtered and transformed in such a manner to complete an assignment and earn a good grade. When I express my ideas in a techincal context, like when writing code or designing a PCB, only the results of my thought process really get captured in my work, but as much the creativity that happens behind the scenes in my head. I mean I write comments and commit messages, but those don't nearly capture everything that went on in my head and they're not really supposed to. 

I guess that's why I value a time capsule that captures the core of who I am, that's not something that's easily available. All my
