Do a quick Google search for ["how to get a software engineering internship"](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=how+to+get+a+software+engineering+internship) and ["how to get an electrical engineering internship"](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=how+to+get+an+electrical+engineering+internship). The software engineers (SWE) get tons of online resources, blog posts, communites, etc. detailing every step of the process, all the tricks of the trade while we get next to nothing. Well not anymore! This EPIC guide will put all those SWE write-ups to shame and share basically everything I know about landing internships based off of my experiences landing offers at Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft, etc. through 100+ inteviews and 500+ applications.

# Disclaimers

By existing, you agree to donate 90% of your lifetime earnings to me for all eternity throughout the universe until the end of time. Just kidding, but there are a few nuances that I want to address because EE is a very broad field and everyone's situation will be different. Be sure to keep these in mind when reading this guide.

## My Experience

First of all, this post will be based off of my experience, so there's going to be tons of inherit biases there. Most of my experience is at big tech companies, so if you're also shooting for those, well you're in luck. If not, be sure to keep that in the back of your mind when reading this. For example, when I go over projects and you're looking to get into the power industry, that might not be as applicable to you. 

Additionally, I'm based in the US and I'm working on my undergrad in California near Silicon Valley. International students may have a different process for internships in their country and there are many more hoops to jump through to land an internship in the US. Grad students may also have a different experience, especially if you're applying for lab- or research-based positions.

That being said, most of this advice will be highly applicable to you, no matter what industry you're going into, but obviously some more than others. Some of my advice around resume-writing and interviews for example extend beyond EE. Just like everything you read on the internet, take this with a grain of salt and remain thoughful of what you want to implement and what you want to ignore.

## Don't Compare Yourself to Others

If you hit all of these points throught the entire post, you're in *very* good shape. But if not, don't feel discouraged or that "I'm not good enough". You wanna hear a secret? There are a ton of points here that I don't even hit. This guide is sort of the 'light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel' thing, an ideal to strive towards. Identify what you're missing and use this guide to build your skills and become a killer applicant.

So don't feel discouraged that you're not in the 99.999999th percentile of EE students implementing each and every one of these points to their absolute perfection. There's only one thing you should compare yourself to and that's yourself from yesterday, not some random post on the internet from some random internet stranger. 

You're going to see your classmates and friends landing internships left and right, and again, don't compare yourself to them. I get it, we're in college and we always compare ourselves to others and stuff. But at the end of the day, remember there's only one person you should compare yourself to and that's yourself from yesterday. And if your friends and classmates are landing amazing internships, that's great! Go leech off them LOL. 

Anyways enough of the fine print let's get going to the real stuff!

## Similarities to SWE

I will be drawing many comparisons to the SWE process because their processes are very similar to our's, but they just have way more resources. For the longest time, I actually had my career set on being a SWE and I still remain quite active in the SWE communities. If you want more tips and stuff, you could also read up on those SWE posts and 95% of their information will be directly applicable to you as an EE, especially if you're looking to get into tech. I will point out many of the key differences throughout this post as they come up so you get a good idea of what to ignore and what to take in. 

Alternatively, if you find out that you actually want to go into SWE as a result of this post, well more power to you! That's even a win for me since SWEs get paid more, so my 90% cut of your compensation (that you agreed to by existing) will continue to grow. 

# Why Do I Need an Internship? 

In my experience, EE students don't hold that same sense of rigor and determination to land internships compared to SWE students, we don't really have that same culture. This culture can be pretty toxic, especially among college-aged students but there are a few benefits as well. 

If you were previously not super motivated to pursue internships, I hope these can convice you otherwise. If you're already super motivated, I hope these push you more!

## Money

I always like to mention money first because so many students (myself included!) get really motiviated when they learn how much money is on the line. Just another disclaimer before I get into the numbers, these are the top-of-the line figures that are very competive with limited seats. Again, don't get discouraged if you're not here yet! I hope these figures help to motiviate you to become the best engineer you can. 

Additionally, many students earning these levels of compensation are typically have a few internships under their belt, and most of the times, their earlier internships weren't paying this much. They busted their ass off to climb the "internship ladder" and that's completely normal so don't get discouraged! Even if your first internship doesn't pay as well, you have a still have a very good shot at landing these in the future! 

Now with that's out of the way, let's get into some actual numbers. Here's what the  compensation breakdown looks like for my return intern offer at Microsoft:

- $8500/mo salary
- $5000 signing bonus
- $7000 housing stipend (post-tax)
- $1500 transportation + relocation stipend

All in all, that's $39,000 for just one summer, which prorates to $156,000 for an entire year! That's over twice the average salary for an entry-level, full-time EE! I'd say that's quite a step up from minimum wage. Now imagine you intern at Microsoft for three or four summers, that's well over $100k you'll be making even before you graduate! 

The best part is Microsoft/FAANG (an acronym for the top tech companies, typically the highest paying) isn't even the highest paying, there are hedge funds/HFT firms out there that pay over twice this for a *very* select few interns. These opportunies are *extremely* competitive and more selective because there are fewer opportunies. 

Unlike for SWE, there aren't many resources out there to explore EE intern compensation. Here are a few resources for SWE intern compensation, just know that at the same company, EE interns will make slightly less than their SWE counterparts, and this difference extends throughout the entire career.  

For example, At Apple, a first-time EE intern gets put at the $36-$40/hr band while a first time SWE intern gets at the $41-44/hr band. This is similar at Facebook as well where the EE interns get $7k/mo while the SWE inters get $8k/mo. At Microsoft, SWE and EE interns and new grads (NGs) actually receive the same compensation, but this isn't very common, Microsoft is the only company I know that offers this. 

Explore intern compensation: 

- [levels.fyi internships](https://www.levels.fyi/internships/): Levels.fyi is an awesome website to explore compensation. I think it was originally intended for SWEs, but as it got more popular, they expanded to other fields as well. I will talk about them more during the compensation section, but here you can browse SWE internship salaries, keeping in mind the points above. 
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kcthwn/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_interns/) [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/isfzuz/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_interns/) [intern](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gufum4/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_interns_june/) [salary](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fc8cp9/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_interns_march/) [share](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e4ve4m/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_interns/) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cylp5r/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_interns/): Sweaty CS students on Reddit post their SWE internship offers. These figures are pretty accurate for the most part. Again, these are SWE salaries to keep in mind the points above. 
- Glassdoor: glassdoor is ok for internships, but it's absolutely terrible for full-time engineers (FTE) because it fails to capture other components of compensation.

And you think inters get paid a lot - now imagine the FTEs. Of course FTEs get paid more, I've seen TC packages at $200k+ for new grad (NG) FTEs and it's going to be these internships that make you a competive application and achieve these compensation figures. I won't drop any numbers here, but check out the [levels.fyi data on it](https://www.levels.fyi/comp.html?track=Hardware%20Engineer). 

Here was a bit of info on compensation that was meant to entice you, but there's a dedicated section later on that goes more in-depth.
