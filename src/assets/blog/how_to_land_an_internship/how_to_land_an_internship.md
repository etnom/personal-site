Do a quick Google search for ["how to get a software engineering internship"](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=how+to+get+a+software+engineering+internship) and ["how to get an electrical engineering internship"](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=how+to+get+an+electrical+engineering+internship). The software engineers (SWE) get tons of online resources, blog posts, communites, etc. detailing every step of the process, all the tricks of the trade while we get next to nothing. Well not anymore! This **EPIC** guide will put all those SWE write-ups to shame and share basically everything I know about landing internships based off of my experiences landing offers at Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft, etc. through 100+ inteviews and 500+ applications.

# Disclaimers

By existing, you agree to donate 90% of your lifetime earnings to me for all eternity throughout the universe until the end of time. Just kidding, but there are a few nuances that I want to address because EE is a very broad field and everyone's situation will be different. Be sure to keep these in mind when reading this guide.

## My Experience

First of all, this post will be based off of my experience, so there's going to be tons of inherit biases there. Most of my experience is at big tech companies, so if you're also shooting for those, well you're in luck. If not, be sure to keep that in the back of your mind when reading this. For example, when I go over projects and you're looking to get into the power industry, that might not be as applicable to you. 

Additionally, I'm based in the US and I'm working on my undergrad in California near Silicon Valley. International students may have a different process for internships in their country and there are many more hoops to jump through to land an internship in the US. Grad students may also have a different experience, especially if you're applying for lab- or research-based positions.

That being said, most of this advice will be highly applicable to you, no matter what industry you're going into, but obviously some more than others. Some of my advice around resume-writing and interviews for example extend beyond EE. Just like everything you read on the internet, take this with a grain of salt and remain thoughful of what you want to implement and what you want to ignore.

## Don't Compare Yourself to Others

If you hit all of these points throught the entire post, you're in *very* good shape. But if not, don't feel discouraged or that "I'm not good enough". You wanna hear a secret? There are a ton of points here that I don't even hit. This guide is sort of the 'light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel' thing, an ideal to strive towards. Identify what you're missing and use this guide to build your skills and become a killer applicant.

So don't feel discouraged that you're not in the 99.999999th percentile of EE students implementing each and every one of these points to their absolute perfection. There's only one thing you should compare yourself to and that's yourself from yesterday, not some random post on the internet from some random internet stranger. 

You're going to see your classmates and friends landing internships left and right, and again, don't compare yourself to them. I get it, we're in college and we always compare ourselves to others and stuff. But at the end of the day, remember there's only one person you should compare yourself to and that's yourself from yesterday. And if your friends and classmates are landing amazing internships, that's great! Go leech off them LOL. 

## Similarities to SWE

I will be drawing many comparisons to the SWE process because their processes are very similar to our's, but they just have way more resources. For the longest time, I actually had my career set on being a SWE and I still remain quite active in the SWE communities. If you want more tips and stuff, you could also read up on those SWE posts and 95% of their information will be directly applicable to you as an EE, especially if you're looking to get into tech. I will point out many of the key differences throughout this post as they come up so you get a good idea of what to ignore and what to take in. 

Alternatively, if you find out that you actually want to go into SWE as a result of this post, well more power to you! That's even a win for me since SWEs get paid more, so my 90% cut of your compensation (that you agreed to by existing) will continue to grow. 

That being said, the inverse is also the case, this guide also has tons of information that will be super helpful to SWEs. Here are some of the biggest differences between the SWE and EE internship process, I've been through both at FAANG and can provide some insight:
- SWEs have a standardized interview process, basically coding riddles that you can grind on a website called Leetcode (LC), EEs we don't. I've only ever had OAs twice for EE roles.
- SWEs get more online assessments (OAs), basically online coding challenges/LC before the interview that act as another set of filters between your application and the job
- FAANG/AFUNGALMASS (Acronym for top companies: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google/Amazon, Facebook, Uber, Netflix, Google, Apple, Lyfy, Microsoft, Airbnb, Snap, Stripe) are often the target companies for most SWEs while for EEs, this isn't really the case. EE is a much broader field, there are less opportunies in tech and many people also shoot for positions in defense, semiconductors, aerospace, utilities/power/energy, biotech, etc which are often "looked down upon" by SWEs and don't offer as attractive salaries.
- EE is much more textbook heavy, our EE concepts are based in physics and math and involve tons of calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, etc. while for SWEs, there's very little math/textbook info required for almost all jobs outside of data structures and algorithms for the interview. Some EE interviews actually expect you to solve complex, mathy transforms or at the very least, solve some circuits.
- Every SWE and their mother has been coding since the womb, coding is much easier to pick up on your own that EE.
- There are way more SWE opportunies out there and way more CS students applying to them.
- There aren't too many EE career communities and resources out there.

Anyways enough of the fine print let's get going to the real stuff!

# Why Do I Need an Internship? 

In my experience, EE students don't hold that same sense of rigor and determination to land internships compared to SWE students, we don't really have that same culture. This culture can be pretty toxic, especially among college-aged students but there are a few benefits as well. 

If you were previously not super motivated to pursue internships, I hope these can convice you otherwise. If you're already super motivated, I hope these push you more!

## Money

I always like to mention money first because so many students (myself included!) get really motiviated when they learn how much money is on the line. Just another disclaimer before I get into the numbers, these are the top-of-the line figures that are very competive with limited seats. Again, don't get discouraged if you're not here yet! I hope these figures help to motiviate you to become the best engineer you can. 

Additionally, many students earning these levels of compensation are typically have a few internships under their belt, and most of the times, their earlier internships weren't paying this much. They busted their ass off to climb the "internship ladder" and that's completely normal so don't get discouraged! Even if your first internship doesn't pay as well, you have a still have a very good shot at landing these in the future! 

### The Numbers

Now with that's out of the way, let's get into some actual numbers. Here's what the  compensation breakdown looks like for my return intern offer at Microsoft (which was SWE, but HWE/EE gets the same TC):

- $8500/mo (~$53/hr) salary 
- $5000 signing bonus
- $7000 housing stipend (post-tax)
- $1500 transportation + relocation stipend

All in all, that's $39,000 for just one summer, which prorates to $156,000 for an entire year! Imagine how much crack you can buy with that! That's over twice the average salary for an entry-level, full-time EE! I'd say that's quite a step up from minimum wage. Now imagine you intern at Microsoft for three or four summers, that's well over $100k you'll be making even before you graduate! 

The best part is Microsoft/FAANG (an acronym for the top tech companies, typically the highest paying) isn't even the highest paying, there are hedge funds/HFT firms out there that pay over twice this for a *very* select few interns (yes, there are some interns making $20k+/mo). These opportunies are *extremely* competitive and more selective because there are fewer opportunies. 

### SWE vs EE

Unlike for SWE, there aren't many resources out there to explore EE intern compensation. Here are a few resources for SWE intern compensation, just know that at the same company, EE interns will make slightly less than their SWE counterparts, and this difference extends throughout the entire career.  

For example, At Apple, a first-time EE intern gets put at the $36-$40/hr band while a first time SWE intern gets at the $41-44/hr band. This is similar at Facebook as well where the EE interns get $7k/mo while the SWE interns get $8k/mo. At Microsoft, SWE and EE interns and new grads (NGs) actually receive the same compensation, but this isn't very common, Microsoft is the only company I know that offers this. 

### Explore More Numbers

Explore intern compensation: 

- [levels.fyi internships](https://www.levels.fyi/internships/): Levels.fyi is an awesome website to explore compensation. I think it was originally intended for SWEs, but as it got more popular, they expanded to other fields as well. I will talk about them more during the compensation section, but here you can browse SWE internship salaries, keeping in mind the points above. 
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kcthwn/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_interns/) [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/isfzuz/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_interns/) [intern](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gufum4/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_interns_june/) [salary](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fc8cp9/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_interns_march/) [share](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e4ve4m/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_interns/) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cylp5r/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_interns/): Sweaty CS students on Reddit post their SWE internship offers. These figures are pretty accurate for the most part. Again, these are SWE salaries to keep in mind the points above. 
- Glassdoor: glassdoor is ok for internships, but it's absolutely terrible for full-time engineers (FTE) because it fails to capture other components of compensation.

And you think inters get paid a lot - now imagine the FTEs. Of course FTEs get paid more, I've seen TC packages at $200k+ for new grad (NG) FTEs and it's going to be these internships that make you a competive application and achieve these compensation figures. I won't drop any FTE numbers here, but check out the [levels.fyi data on it](https://www.levels.fyi/comp.html?track=Hardware%20Engineer). 

Here was a bit of info on compensation that was meant to entice you, but there's a dedicated section later on that goes more in-depth. 

## Experience

The experience gained during an internship is actually way more important than money, but I find that talking about intern comp turns more heads than gaining experience. Maybe us college students don't have our priorities straight, but you can be the judge of that. 

### Hands-On Experience

As you can probably imagine, working in the industry is actually pretty different from school. I don't know of any engineers grinding Laplace Transforms at work, but how many LTs did you do in school? Having hands-on experience is incredibly valuable as I'll detail later. 

Unlike for SWE, you it's very difficult to get hands-on experience on your own. I'm not sure about you, but I personally don't have a $500k lab setup in my bedroom. At this point in our lives, the only way to get lab experience is at school or at work, and apparently not every school offers a ton of hands-on lab exposure. 

The information taught at school is typically pretty disconnected from the industry. My school doesn't cover communication protocols, PCB design, DC-DC converters, and motor drive design, and even when they do, it isn't until like senior year or grad school. Students with only academic expierence would have trouble answering common hands-on/practical knowledge-based interview questions like "What's the difference between I2C and SPI?" or "Design a circuit to drive a motor from a microcontroller" because those sorts of things just aren't taught in school. 

I can't really fault the school for this, but practical information like this can really only be picked up through personal projects and industry experience and are pretty critical to passing interviews. They're also critical for the job, but you can pick them up during the job, that's much harder to do during the interviews. And even when you can pick it up during the job, I'd prefer to maximize my on-the-fly learning focused on more job-specific information.

### Impact

Companies recognize the value of interns and that turning interns into productive engineers ends up benefiting the company/team in the long run. That's why these internships aren't your coffeeboy internships (it's a shame I even need to mention that, so many people think they are). At these internships, interns have real opportunies to make impact. For example, at Microsoft, I the code I wrote got productized and shipped out to the final product to do cool stuff I can even say. We need to sign NDAs because we really do work on top secret stuff and learn about product roadmaps. iPhone interns actually work on the next-gen iPhones, you get the idea. It's just an awesome feeling to know that you built something that millions of customers will use. 

Interns typically work alongside FTEs and are delegated the same tasks and they get the real experience of what it's like as an FTE. It's in the company's best interest to get you acustomed to working there and put on real tasks to get you to return. 

### Exploring EE

EE is a *very* broad field. There's so much out there yet we have so little time at school to explore everything, our undergrad barely covers the fundementals. Internships are a great opportunity to explore what you do and don't want to do in your career. You get a ton of hands-on experience and exposure to a wide variety of real-world topics and it's a great opportunity to pick and choose what you want to continue for your career and focus on in school. 

Interns have a great deal of mobility, we're in and out in three months, no obligations needed. That's why it's the perfect opportunity to explore everything. We know so little but we can learn so much when we're young. One summer go work at a startup, the next go to a big tech company, and after that to defense. Go explore PCB design one summer, computer architecture the next, and analog design after. When you go FTE, you don't get that same level of mobility. You can join a company FTE and leave after three months, see how that goes for you (life pro tip: don't do this!).  There are rotational programs, but that's exactly what internships are for. 

Knowing what you *don't* want to do is just as important as knowing what you *do* want to. I'd rather "waste" a summer doing something I thought I enjoyed but learning that I don't as opposed to actually wasting years of my career doing the same. 

Again, EE is a broad field and we can do a lot with our degree. When you get the "buffet", you figure out what you like and don't like, but none of that experience goes down the drain. You'll know what you like and don't like *at the moment*, but life is dynamic. In a few years when circumstances change, you may want to pivot your career. Your internship "buffet" experience can prove extemely useful in these circumstances where you can make a much better decision having actually experienced a few options. 

Maybe you did an internship at a startup and it turns out you don't like it *right now*, it was fast paced and you had a lot of freedom without the politics. The next summer you move to big tech and wow it's a blast! So you decide to go into big tech to start your FTE career but after a few years, it gets kinda dry and you want out. It's too slow for you and you feel bogged down by office politics. But wait! You did an internship a few years back at that startup free of these exact burdens! No experience is bad experience (ok not always, but you get the idea I'm trying to make here) and having all the background puts you in a very powerful position.

Remember, an internship is like an extended interview, and interviews go both ways! It's a way for your company to evaluate you but also an opportunity for you to evaluate your company. 

### Context

School is super conceptual and much of the material often feels disconnected from the industry, which is absolutely true. This isn't really a fault of our EE programs and education system, the conceptual background is very important to become a successful engineer. But when you understand the physical and practical context where those concepts get applied, it makes learning those concepts much easier. You actually feel motivated to learn the concepts, it feels less like you're grinding through some random math stuff and more like you're learning why a physical system you're familiar with works and behaves the way it does. 

Fourier Transforms can feel like annoying plug-and-chug math, but when you get to work with practical applications of the frequency space, gears begin to click and "Ah hah! That's where it comes from!". You begin to understand and appreciate the true beauty of all this "random, janky math" and the school's curriculum begins to make a lot more sense.

School gets way more interesting and fun and you begin to learn more and more after realizing that the school material barely scratches the surface of what's actually happening. You go far beyond the textbook and end up getting a much more valuable and enriching educational experience at no extra cost, just motivation and background!

## New Grad Compensation

As you complete more and more internships, you become a much more competitive applicant with valuable experience and and strong skillsets. Being a strong, competitive applicant gives you much more negotiation power to earn higher NG TC (total compensation). A company is of course going to prefer someone with more relevant industry experience and has previously proven themselves to be a successful engineer and will offer a higher TC accordingly. 

Additionally, you'll look more attractive to not only a one company, but many more. You'll begin to collect competing offers that opens up your options but also provides tons of leverage for negotiation. Most companies don't budge too much on TC, but once competing offers are introduce, things just got serious. It's common for NGs to negotiate their TCs up by tens of thousands, sometimes even over 100k, from competing offers. 

## Return Offers

Internships are like extended interviews, and if you perform well in your "three-month interview", there's a good chance you'll get a return offer! Return offers save you from the stress of another application season, but also offer TC benefits as well. Many companies offer higher TCs for returning interns. For example, Facebook gives high performing "Rockstar" interns a $100k *signing* bonus and the base Microsoft TC packages differ by $20-30k for returning interns.

Not all companies offer return intern bonuses, but still strong returning interns have more leverage during negotiations. A strong intern has already proven themselves to be a strong performer while some random NG entering through the standard interview pipelines is much riskier, the team doesn't know how well they'll perform. That "random NG" will be much riskier to invest in. There are interviews to assess their skillset and knowledge, but a "three-month interview" is a much stronger assessment than a regular two-day/five-round interview.  

It's also very expensive and time consuming to hire a brand new candidate. There are costs with the recruiter and all the time (and money) spend interviewing the candidate, so a previous intern who's skillset is a known is much safer and often prefered. 

## Career Growth

 I'm not anywhere in my career yet, so I can't offer too much insight on this section, but here are some general ideas I hear thrown around. Valuable internship experience can also help to skyrocket your career. The technical skillset and background gained through internship experience puts a strong intern candidate head-and-shoulders above their peers. A returning intern also already knows the ins and out of the company and can hop right into the deep end and start working on the cool stuff. A brand new hire will need learn everything and need lots of handholding to get up to speed. I've been told by recruiters and hiring mangers that returning interns often outpeform new hires because they're already familiar with everything and can hop right in. Finding your passion through internships helps to learn better faster in the job you most enjoy.

## Fun!

Internships are a blast! There's of course the technical side of things which I find a ton of fun, but there's also the *fun* fun stuff that not everyone may know about. Companies know that interns are young and energetic and they want to give interns an opportunity to explore the company and the surrounding area. They want to sell the interns on the company, they want the interns to return as happy, productive engineers. 

Companies host *tons* of awesome intern events, including but not limited to:

- Nvidia: Party at the CEO's epic mansion
- Microsoft: Intern day - interns get flown out to the HQ in Redmond for epic party + concert (with famous artisits like Chance the Rapper, Chainsmokers, etc)
- Microsoft: Company-wide Hackathon
- Apple: Legit Q&A with Tim Cook at Apple's top secret, underground Steve Jobs theater
- Paintball
- Sports games
- Game nights
- Movie nights (Apple rented out entire theaters for us)
- Trips to nearby attractions like Yosemite, Lake Tahoe, etc. (for the Bay Area)
- Parties
- Amusement parks
- Rafting
- Go carting

Yeah I'm sure you get the idea by now. And many of those intern activies are typically paid for and everything. Unfortunatley, Covid is meddling with a ton of these activities, but [here's another post I wrote on my internship experience at Microsoft, including all of the fun stuff!](http://montychoy.com/blog/my_remote_software_engineering_internship_experience_at_microsoft_summer_2020#fun_stuff)

In addition to the company-sponsored intern-wide events, there's so much more. Internships are basically a massive collection of the best minds all at the same age from all around the world living and working together - sounds kinda like school right? Except at internships, no one has homework and everyone has money so you can do all the fun stuff of school without needing to worry about exams or going broke. My friends took trips to Las Vegas, LA, Disneyland, etc. during their internships. Exploring California can be especially fun if it's your first time and you're from across the country or even from across the world. 

Many companies offer intern housing, meaning they give you an appartment/hotel to live in for the internship. I'll get more into this later on, but some companies like Apple basically rent out an *entire* appartment complex to house their interns.  Google used to this, but one time the interns partied too hard and it annoyed the neighbors, so they cancelled the housing program (I'm serious, look it up!). With all the interns living together, it's sort of like the social dorm life but most of the interns are in their junior year so they already know how to drink and hopefully people aren't stupid enough to shit in the showers. The appartments are nice and clean, so the experience ends up being as social as the dorms without the drawbacks.

## Swag

I was highly debating putting this section first instead of the Money section since college students love free stuff too, but I think people care *slightly* more about money over swag. 

Companies really want to sell you on their company because they want you to stay and attract the best talent, so they offer tons of swag. There's of course the standard stuff like stickers, pencils, and t-shirts, but also the cooler stuff like:

- Branded Hydroflasks
- Xboxs
- Surface/Beats Headphones
- Phones
- Laptops
- Hoodies/Jackets (Patagonia, North Face, etc)
- Backpacks (Timbuk2, Patagonia, North Face, etc)

In my other post about my [Microsoft experience, I also included a dedication section on swag. ](http://localhost:3000/blog/my_remote_software_engineering_internship_experience_at_microsoft_summer_2020#swag)

## Clout

We're young, this matters to us for some reason. Enjoy it while it lasts!

# To Underclassmen - Finding the Motivation

It's very difficult to land internships as a freshman or sophomore and especially as a high schooler, but there are still tons of things to get you ahead of the curve. Unfortunately, EE is a very textbook-heavy field where a strong understanding of math, physics, and EE concepts are necessary to perform well, and most of these aren't taught until junior or senior year. This isn't like SWE where you really only need to take one sophomore-level class to prepare you for 90% of SWE, and that class can easily be self-studied, no EE is *real* engineering (jk ofc). 

I wanted to highlight this section so that the underclassmen can see something and say "Hey! this applies to me! I'll actually read it!" instead of skimming through 20000 words of nonsense (this is my guess at how long this post will be upon writing this, I'm currently at ~4500). I have another section below targetted at underclassmen, but this section will focus on *why* you should start building on your skills now and later on, I'll go over *what* specific things you can do starting early to give yourself the best advantage later on. 

This will be emphasized so much: get started early. The best time to get started was yesterday, but the second-best time is *now*. If I could attribute my internship success to one thing that's under my control, it would be that I started early. 

## It's Intimidating

I get it, I was also in your shoes. Seeing those big, bearded, smart-looking EEs practicing sorcery is intimidating. "I'm not good enough". "I'll just try later when I get better". "Nobody wants me". Face-to-face/social networking events like career fairs exacerbate these feelings tenfold. These are all valid emotions. Everyone gets these feelings. My friend with a 4.0 GPA still gives me that "I'm not good enougggghhhhh" when she has a **4.0 GPA**. Wanna hear another secret? I still get these feelings. I have two top internships, tons of projects, and tons of passion, and I still feel inadequate. You were looking for tips from me on how to get past those feelings weren't you? Well if you find them, feel free to let me know because I'm also looking. 

Dealing with these feelings is different for everyone. If I was good at managing my emotions, well I probably wouldn't be writing this post. But here are a few of my solutions. 

- Go with friends: Take advantage of our underdeveloped brains and out-of-control hormones and emotions and peer pressure yourself and your friends to go together. It gets much easier. Even just going to the career fair to walk around stealing swag is an amazing start.
- The first one is always the hardest: Just do one, and after that one, you'll realize it's not that bad. All that anxiety was artificial, and when then comes to light, it becomes much easier to manager. Also, it's actually pretty fun, just like crack.
- Just do it: Not going to lie, this is how I did it. I basically told myself "no balls" and went up to some random guy at the Apple booth during the career fair. A month later, I got the job!
- Companies give tons of free stuff: At career fairs, companies often give out tshirts, socks, snacks, chargers, notepooks, pens, pencils, and other small freebees. They want people to go to them, even if it's just to jack some swag LOL. They also know that many people are hesitant to attend for a variety of reasons, including those feelings of inadequacy. And once you go to that booth to jack that nice Hydro, since your there, you might as well give it a shot and talk to a hiring manager!
- Get drunk/high: When you're under the influence, your confidence shoots up tenfold. (Don't do this!)
- It's not your job to reject yourself: By not even going and applying, you're rejecting yourself. You're not even giving yourself the chance. It's not your job to reject you, it's the recruiter's. 
- Use the section earlier on "Why Internships..." to calculate how much money you're losing by not getting out there. If you get an internship this summer and next, that's a potential $50k in your pocket from just those two internships, another $50k/yr in your NG TC, and even more as your career progresses. That could be over a million dollars you're loosing out on just because of some random twiggly thingies in your brain!
- Even if it doesn't feel like it, these feelings will subside naturally. You get older, you get experience, and you gain the confidence to fight these back. But while you're experiencing them, you can either let yourself continue to be controlled by these invalid, irrational emotions, costing your career and wallet. Or, you can stop being a pussy and get out there. The more you put yourself out there, the more confident you become, and the less you'll be controlled by these feelings.
- Do a rational, cost-benefit analysis like this one: 

![cost benefit analysis](images/cost_benefit_analysis.png)

## We All Start Somewhere

Don't feel bad or intimidated that most of the upperclassmen around you know know more than you. That's just how things work. But let me tell you something, you're probably a good deal further ahead than them just by reading this post. A ton of EE students don't have this much internship application experience and you're getting all for free here! The fact that you're reading this post, especially this far down, shows a great amount of initiative and dedication and speaks volumes for your character. 

Instead, recognize that there are so many opportunies to grow. EE is a very broad and deep field, many people way smarter than both of us combined have spent their entire lives studying this stuff and there's still way more out there. Use this to humble yourself and as motivation to push yourself to learn more, but at the same time, don't underestimate yourself and put yourself out there because you never know what amazing opportunies are waiting for you right around the corner. 

## What's the Worst that can Happen? 

There's so much to gain yet so little to lose. What's the worst that can happen? You embarrass yourself in front of some random recruiter who sees 1000 people a day and won't remember you five minutes later? And what's the best that can happen? You land an awesome internship that catapults your career forward. That risk/reward ratio is off the charts, there's no risk and so much reward. 

## No Experience is Useless Experience

The best way to learn many things is to experience it yourself, and this is again true for the application process. This guide may serve as a reference for you, but keep in mind that this guide was based off of my experiences and there's a pretty good chance you're not me living through my exact same situation. 

Ultimately, you should navigate the application process in the best manner that fits you. Maybe this guide aligns well with that, maybe it doesn't. But the only way for you to find out is to go out there and learn by doing. Figure out what's the best way to approach the interviews based on your skillset and strengths. Play around a little, test out some of my advice and play with it. 

By going to the career fair, doing interviews, and putting yourself out there, you're going through that process and developing the intuition yourself by doing which is way more powerful than some random online thingy. You get a good idea of how things work and can better develop your own methods and strategies to tailor the experience to yourself and your situation. 

Even if you don't get an internship, you still have all of that valuable experience navigating the process and next year, you'll know exactly what to do. I'd rather spend my freshman and sophomore years learning the best approaches and applying them during my junior and senior year when the stakes are much higher. When you go to the career fair and start applying for the *first* time during your junior or senior year, you're going to have to learn the best approaches and apply them on the fly which makes everything much more difficult, especially when you're navigating  your junior year internship or new grad opportunies where these decisions can really drive the direction of your career. 

Talking to engineers and hiring managers is also a great way to get insight into the industry. You can talk about the working experience, culture, everyday challenges, etc of that industry, company, team, or line of work and this information can help drive your career decisions moving forward. 

## Preparing for the Future

In addition to the skills and experience acquired by putting yourself out there, you can also ask for tangible, technical skills and tips to implement now. Remember, companies want interns, they want you. If you don't meet the bar now, they always look forward to see you improve and come back next year even better than before. At the career fairs or interviews, ask them "what skills can I learn to become better for next year?" and they'll gladly give you advice on what to learn, what classes to take, what projects to work on, etc. because they are also looking for the best candidates, and this is an opportunity for them now to initiate that. Take that advice and run with it and there's a solid chance you'll be a killer applicant next time around. 

Companies often delegate the same recruiters/hiring managers to manage recruiting, hiring, and the career fair at the same schools. I often hear stories of freshmen going to a company at a career fair, but the hiring manager, after assessing the student, decides that the student doesn't meet the requirements but offers the students resources and tips on how to improve and make themselves a competitive applicant. Sophomore year, the student does the same and establishes a rapport with the hiring manager and by the time junior year comes around, that student is a perfect fit! 

The experience, insight, and information available at career events and interviews are just as important as the internship itself and these resources are available to everyone, you just need to take the initiative and go for it! 

## Experience Compounds

The sheer amount of advantage you can achieve just by starting out a few months or years is actually pretty insane. All that experience just keeps adding up faster and faster. Those projects you do in high school can help you land internships in your freshman year, and that internship helps you land even better internships in your sophomore year, and all that just compounds insanely fast, especially because internships are so valuable and internships don't come in big volumes. If you're a really *really* good student, you'll land three - four internships during your undergrad, while a good student may only land one or two. One internship already means *a lot*, now imagine three or four of them. Internship experience typically isn't linear, meaning that four internships is often has way more than 2x the value compared to two internships.  

![starting_early_graph](images/starting_early_graph.png)

Even though this graph isn't scaled and doesn't account for all the variables or anything, I hope it demostrates the main idea of how much advantage you're gaining by starting early, and this gap can be reflected in your TC and career progression. Experience and knowledge compounds, you use previous experience to get more experience. This doesn't account for internship experience or the vast amount of learning resources at your disposal while in college, which would further skew the data in favor of starting in middle school and high school.

## Getting Your Foot in the Door

When you start getting involved in the intership scene, there's a good chance, even if you're awkward like me, to come across engineers, hiring managers, recruiters, and other students and make valuable networking connections. You never know how valuable these connections can be down the line and the more you have, the better. Recruiters and hiring managers love it when underclassmen network with them, it shows so much dedication and initiative and it could be a pretty good indicator of that student being a killer applicant later on because they're starting this early. 

Here's a story that I hope seals the nail in the coffin for how important getting started early with networking is, especially as an underclassmen. This was during my first quarter at school only a few weeks in when I was still figuring out how to college. Microsoft held this "Demystifying the Technical Resume & Interview" workshop and I decided to attend because, well Microsoft. They also had free dinner and valuable insight on the whole interview process (well not as valuable and thorough as this guide of course!). After the event, they typically leave the floor open for networking and chatting, so I go up to a recruiter (who I later find out to be Cal Poly's Microsoft recruiter) and ask her genuine questions about putting my company on my resume. Well I chat with her and she sounds super interested! She invites me to find her at the Computer Career Fair the next day (which I'll go into later) and I also end up getting an interview at Microsoft!

Towards the end of our quick chat, she also introduced me a student who had just finished up an EE internship with them ([he just posted a dope video on improving your resume!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JmdTN1bBOw)) and I remember him being super helpful to get that initial push of confidence and put myself out there. I left him on read but that's what he gets for taking six days to respond lol.

![russell convseration](images/russell_conversation.png)

Fast forward almost exactly one year to October 2019 and I'm again searching for internships for the following 2020 summer. After getting discouraging career fair results, I decide to reach out to that same recruiter and try to use some good old nepotism to get myself an internship. I'm not sure how well it worked, but I ended up getting an internship so I'm not complaining. I like to think it wasn't the nepotism that got me the role, but the fact that I got rejected without any interviews from *every single* internship role I applied to this year at Microsft, even with a return offer, indicates otherwise.

## PTSD

I know it's difficult to land an internship as an underclassman, here's another quick story that basically summarizes the trauma. I was at the career fair after my nine-month Apple co-op looking for internships. It was only my second quarter at school, so being the honest person I am, I claimed that I was a freshman, which was true. I go up to a recruiter the the Texas Instruments (TI) booth, hand her my resume, and do my elevator pitch: "Hi, I'm Monty, I'm a first-year - " and she cut me off after those first six words, handed me back my resume without ever looking at it, and dismissed me with "sorry, we don't hire freshman, company policy" and I believed it so I didn't get too upset.

Now that's not even the good part. The next quarter (I was still a freshman, it was my third quarter at school), I again went up to the TI booth, did my elevator pitch with no interruptions and landed an interview on the spot. I thought it was strange, considering how the previous recruiter dismissed me, but again, I didn't think too much of it. The interview went really well and at the end, I asked if they really had that "we don't hire freshman" policy and my interview said no. At this point, I was a bit upset but what happened in the passed happened, not much I can do about it so I continued on with my life. 

Apparently, since I went through the career fair, I needed to also apply online to get my name in the system and actually apply for a req, all that business stuff. They let me know that I'm applying kind of late, so there might not be too many applications open. My interviewer worked on power electronics which was one of my interests, so I went online to look for that role assuming they were hiring, but to my surprise, there were only like five postings, four of which were business/non-technical, the last one being some digital design stuff I wasn't interested in. Well shoot, they were out of roles because it's later in the application season. If I applied in the fall/if the recruiter didn't dismiss me after six words, I probably would've found something. I ended up applying to that one digital role, getting autorejected, and to this day, I still get autorejected from TI.

So that's the story of why I avoid telling people my year in school and if asked, I just tell everyone that I'm a junior (which is what it says on my online portal, so it's not a lie).

# The Company's Perspective

As interns and applicants, it can be easy to forget what's behind the face of these massive companies. I don't myself indentify as a company, but maybe I can offer some helpful insights on the company's interests that may not be as apparent. I've been talking a lot about how companies want you and that sort of stuff, so let me elaborate. 

First of all, companies *want* you. They want interns. They want the most talented students to both continue their products that make them money and also to prevent the competition from poaching talent. They pay the big bucks, offer amazing perks, host awesome events; big companies invest in tens of millions of dollars every year into their internship programs to poach and retain top talent. 

In addition to retaining talent, these companies also want to train that talent. Remember how earlier, I mentioned that returning, trained interns progress their careers faster? Well this is also benefitial for not only the interns not also the companies as they get access to better trained, higher quality engineers that can come in and hit the ground running.

Companies aren't spending tons of money for nothing, they themselves also realize the value of internship programs and compete against each other, millions of dollars at a time, for the top talent. In many cases, the relationship between the company and the employee is very much symbiotic. The company knows that it's nothing without the employees and companies are smart enough to realize the value of highly skilled employees. Internships programs are a way to support that initiative, companies are smart enough to realize that a "small" investment in interns pays off many times over in the long run. 

# The Overall Process

Wow I'm already almost 7500 words in and I haven't even gotten into the juicy stuff yet. I was considering splitting this into a few different posts, but I'm not too sure how that does on ad revenue. In terms of writing, I don't even think I'm halfway though yet, so here's a quick overview of what's to come. It can get difficult to navigate huge walls of text for the important stuff, so here's a quick snapshot of what the overall application process looks like: 

- Prepare your application: Develop your skillset and get your resume and supplementing resources ready, reviewed, and locked down - how do you stand out as an applicant? 
- Apply: Actually apply to jobs online, through the career fair, and through nepotism
- Interview: Git grilled for hours and hours on end. There are typically many rounds, some technical, some behavior, some screens.
- Offers!: Yay you got the offer! But that's not it, you still need to decide between offers, negotiate, plan stuff out, etc.

There aren't too many resources out there about this stuff so I often hear a ton of misinformation circulating around about the application process so I hope the following sections clear everything up for you to help you navigate the process and to make the best decisions for yourself. 

# Pre-Application

Even before you send out your first application, there are still a few things I'd highly recommend getting under your belt to make you a competitive applicant. That being said, don't feel like you need each and every single one of these to be a successful applicant, like I said I don't even have them all. These are sort of a guideline to help you build up your application and it's difficult to juggle schoolwork, extracurriculars, work, and everything. Keep building on everything in parallel, but be sure to consider the timeline. 

## The Pre-App Timeline

The earlier you apply, the better, but sometimes companies have their own hiring timeline that don't always align with everyone else. Be sure to keep the timeline into account when building your skills, sometimes you need to make a tradeoff between applications and skill-building. But don't wait, don't procrastinate. It isn't always worth it to wait a few weeks to wrap up that project before sending out applications because those few weeks can be the differnce between securing or loosing that dream internship. That balancing act between applications and skill building is difficult and different for everyone, which is why it's so important to start earlier and know what you're getting yourself into. 

It's very important to apply early because many companies hire on a rolling basis, meaning they start hiring let's say in August, and once they're out of spots, they're out of spots, especially now with Covid where companies might not be able to afford massive intern classes. If you apply to that company in say November when their seats are almost full, it's going to be much more difficult for you to land that internship especially when considering the lengthy interview processes. I got burned by this a few times so watch out! 

Every company has their own timeline, so try to read up on that beforehand for your top companies. Some companies like Microsoft hire their hardware engineers from September - December, other companies like Google and Amazon wait until the winter, and other companies like Apple are team-dependant and will hire summer interns starting as early as the previous July all the way through the year. 

### Summer

Yep, that's right, the summer *before* that next summer's internship. A *whole year* in advanced is when you should start thinking about applications. The summer application season isn't as intense as the fall/winter, but be aware of the timeline. You should be developing your skillset ideally since you were born, but the deadline on that isn't as strict as it is for internships. Many companies open up their applications in June - July of the previous summer and may even close in August or September school begins for you. 

Other applications may also open up in August or September which is still summer break for those of us on the quarter system. The unfair part is that those on the semester system may get evaluated earlier and get first shot at the available seats. Some companies like Microsoft have a certain amount of seats reserved for the quarter students who typically apply later, but I can't say the same for other companies. 

#### Referrals

If you have friends doing internships, reach out to them for referrals during this time. They typically aren't doing their internship during the year and they usually need to be working to submit the referral. Additionally, many interns have their "grind time" during the last two weeks to wrap up their projects and prepare for presentations and may not have time to accommdate your referral, so as always, the earlier the better. I'll talk a bit more later on about referrals, but this is just about the timeline. 

#### Off-Season Internships

Many off-season co-ops for the following Fall or Winter also open up during the summer. Off-season internships aren't as common as summer internships, so there isn't as much data on the timeline for these, but just remember, the earlier the better. Applying for these off-season internships may be helpful to get your foot in the door. 

This is purely speculative as this hasn't happened to me or anyone else I know, but if you land an off-season internship but get rejected for the summer position for whatever reason, there may be the opportunity to move that off-season internship to the summer. 

If you get invited for a phone screen/interview for an off-season internship, you have some recruiter contacts you can reach out to in the future. You also get an idea of how the interview process works (the more interview experience you have the better!) and if you don't perform up to par, you can always ask for feedback and improve to apply for the summer position a few weeks later with a great advantage.

#### Leveraging Other Offers 

If you have a return offer, that return offer may have a deadline. This deadline can be a few weeks or even months after you complete your internship, depending on the company and even your school. If your return offer deadline is within a few weeks of your last day of the internship, that's a tough deadline to meet and make a decision. The whole interview process may take a few weeks and that might not be enough time to go through the entire interview process at your target companies. 

If you start applying during the summer, you get a better buffer timeline-wise to get competing offers and decide where you want to continue at next summer. These competing offers can help with internship negotiation (yep that's a thing!) and just open up more doors for you. Even if a company hasn't begun their recruiting pipeline yet, if you have the contact info of a recruiter or hiring manager, you may be able to expediate that process using a competing return offer as leverage. 

### Fall (August - December)

Fall and winter is when most of the applying happens, you should start applying here! Companies also want to start hiring earlier to poach the best talent. For SWEs, most of the applying is focused in the fall and extends a bit into the winter with most of the available positions considerably dwindling in the spring. During the holidays and breaks, hiring slows down so be sure to take that into consideration. Many companies begin hiring during the fall and have almost everything finalized by the winter, so be sure not to miss that window!

The exact timeline in the fall differs a bit by company, but I begin applying when school starts for me in mid-September and by this time, there area already tons of postings out. This is pretty late so I'd actually suggest to start applying even earlier. In the fall, I typically apply up until around Thanksgiving time if I'm satisfied with my results, otherwise I still continue to apply. Interviews usually happen for me in October - November with a few extending out into December and offers come in November - December. That's a whole three to four months or applying but if I don't find anything good, I'll need to continue into winter.

And to further incentivize you to being applying early in the fall and summer, here are some ballpark figures that will scare you away from beginning your application season in the winter or spring. If I had to best guess, I'd say that ~50% of EE internships are filled up by January. This means that if you start applying in January, your chances are basically half that of starting in August, and for your first internship, this can play a massive difference when you need everything you can get. And come spring when I'd guess that 95% of EE internships are filled, your chances are even worse. 

### Winter (January - March)

Ideally, you should have begun applying in the fall and your search has just extended out to the winter as well. If you're just starting to apply in the winter, you're not in the best shape but it's still recoverable. There are still a ton of opportunties avaiable during the winter, so don't get discouraged if you're still looking. 

For SWEs, there aren't too many opportunies left but still plenty remain. For EEs, I don't have exact figures but again there are still many opportunies available. At my school's career fair, there may be a few less companies but there are still a ton. A few companies also exclusively recruit EEs for summer internships during the winter including Amazon, Google, and a few teams at Apple. A team I'm in touch with at Apple recruits for their summer interns in the winter as the fall season is reserved for winter interns. I landed my Summer 2021 internships earlier that winter in February - March, so don't give up!

### Spring (March - May/June)

If you're still looking or just starting your search in the spring, you're sort of in trouble. There are typically very few opportunies left this close to the summer. I actually hear of people *starting* their search in the spring - don't do this!!! There are still a few opportunies left, but at this point most students have their internships secured. It's rare, but some bigger companies actually do their recruiting in the spring. I got an internship at Qualcomm in April, although I'm not sure if that's their regular schedule or just a Covid anomaly. 

At this point, I would recommend focusing your efforts on smaller and local companies that do have the flexibility to take on interns so close to their start date. There are a few big companies that do limited hiring, I would assume that's just to fill any last minute slots from renegs and other outstanding circumstances, but definitely don't bank on this. 

## Networking

We all hear about how important networking is because it is! I want to put networking earlier in this pre-app section because it ideally precedes a lot of applications and is pretty continuous, you do it all year round, even after landing your internship or even during the actual internship. I'll also throw in more specific networking advice in their dedication sections as they come up. I'm also awkard af and I wouldn't call myself "good" at networking or anything so my networking insights will be more limited compared to everything else. 

### What is Networking? 

### The Power of Networking

### How do I do it? 

- that werid guy

## What do you even want to do?

Again, EE is a massive field and there's so much out there. Figuring out what you want to do is difficult but it can be helpful to focus your explorations. Even just a "I want to work on spaceships" is very good, you don't need to be super exact, and most of the times, you shouldn't be. You need to play a clever balance between what you want to do, what's available in your reach, and what's out there. You're going to have a tough time landing post grad-level EE research internships at CERN as a freshman for example. 

### Balance Your Focus

You don't always want to focus yourself on one super specific topic or area, especially for your first internship. For example, let's say you want to work on smart phones so you *only* apply to companies that make smart phones like Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi, Google, and Microsoft. Well these are all very competitive companies and there's a good chance, especially for your first internship, you get rejected from all of them. Well if that's the case, since you *only* applied to these companies, you're sort of out of luck. 

That's why I would highly suggest diversifying your applications, especially for your first internship. As you get more and more internship experience and discover where you want to take your career and gain valuable, localized experience, it makes more sense to apply to more specific roles. For your first internship, you want to cast a wide net, you might not get exactly what you want, but an internship in something you 60% enjoy is better than no internship at all. Any experience is super valuable and you can use that first internship as a stepping stone into stuff you really want to do.

There's also a good shot you actually don't know what you really want to do either. We're young, our classes and experiences only cover a tiny sliver of what's out there. If you really want to work in defense but your first internship is on robotics, you might find out that you really like working on robotics! This goes back to the "no experience is useless experience" idea. It's great to have a focus, but don't always soley strive for that focus when you're first starting out. 

### What's Out There

With that in the back of your mind, here are a few industries you can expolre as an EE. I'm not even going to bother with the disciplines since that's something I know even less about. Whatever sounds the most interesting to you, go for it! This is by no means an exhaustive list, there's so much stuff out there I don't know about and it would be impossible to capture that here. Whatever you find the most interesting, please do your own research because there's so much more out there.

## Getting Started Early

The best thing to help your application is to get started early. EE isn't like SWE where everyone and their mother has been coding since the womb. It's very difficult and expensive to get hands-on EE experience on your own and many EE students didn't choose EE the same way many CS students chose CS. I can not emphasize how important it is to start early, it provides a massive advantage over your peers and gives you a huge leg up when searching for internships. 

I started coding when I was 12 and started to teach myself electronics a few years later at 15. I funded my projects through my summer coding teacher job and starting my own company and my extensive background before entering college is the biggest reason why I landed so many amazing internships.

If you're reading this and you're in high school or even midde school that's awesome you're so far ahead! If not, don't feel disadvantaged, you're the norm! Probably around 95% of EE students don't have any prior EE experience and it's definitely not expected of you, no one will mark you down for not having prior experience. 

The previous section "To Underclassmen" went over *why* you should start early, now the rest of this will detail *what* you can do.

### Arduino

Here are a few tips to those of you starting early. I was also in your shoes and there are tons of resources out there to teach yourself. I may dedicate an entire separate post for this, but here are some quick tips. I'd recommend getting started with Arduino to get your feet wet in electronics and coding. Don't be afraid to code! It's an awesome skill actually make electronics so much easier for you. Try to get a simple Arduino starter kit, you can find them online for as cheap as $20-$30 although there are many fancier kits out there. 

Start small, find an online tutorial to hold your hand, first at blinking an LED, then learn how to use buttons. Learn the fundementals as you go, *why* are things happening the way they are? When you decrease the resistance, why does the LED get brighter? No need to get into any of that complex math, a conceptual understanding is solid. Start working with cool peripherals like sensors, screens, motors, etc. and you basically know enough to make your own game! 

### Google it!

Don't be afraid to Google stuff! If you don't have a technical mentor, it can be intimitating but Google everything! Run into a coding bug? Google it! Want to learn how to use a sensor? Google it!! You have almost everyting known to man at your fingertips. This skill to Google search everything isn't as intuitive as you may think but it will stick with you for the rest of your life. Knowing that the world gets so much smaller when you utilize Google is reassuring. At first, it will be challenging but soon it becomes second nature and your most valuable skill. I recommended Arduino because there are tons of online resources and forums, so when you Google stuff, you'll actually find it! Then, as you move into more complex topics where the Google searches aren't as nice, you'll have the background and intuition on how to navigate the results and find what you need. 

### Your First PCB!

Now that you have a cool project, time to make it robust and mobile on its own PCB! PCBs are awesome projects and there are tons of resources online to hold your hand along the way. There are tons of services to make PCBs for you that are quick and affordable. And plus, they make killer resume projects that you can show off at your interviews!

### Find Your Passion

But ultimately, the most important thing about starting early is finding your passion. Maybe after a few projects, you find that EE isn't for you, coding is way more fun. It's way better to figure that out over a $20 kit and a few hours of your time, that beats $50,000 and a few semesters at school. Many students enter EE not knowing exactly what they want to do and after a few EE classes, they find out that EE isn't for them. I think something like 60-70% of EEs transfer out of the program and I'd rather sacrifice a few hours of my own time in middle school to figure that out. 

But maybe you do find out that EE is your passion - even better! My passion in EE is one of the best things that happened to me, it's the intersection between a great career, doing what I love, and amazing pay. When you're truely passionate about something, you will get good at it and you will dedicate all your time and effort into it. Don't have time? Your passion will find you time. 

# Your Application

Wow 10,000 words in and I'm finally getting to the actual application. I hope that helps to illustrate that there's so much that happens before you even write the first line on your resume. That's why preparation and starting early is so helpful, having that time developing your skillset, building projects, etc puts you miles ahead and I can't emphasize this enough. 

There are three pillars to your application that gets wrapped up and presented to recruiters/hiring managers in the form of a resume: 

- Experience
- Projects
- Education

You can also include accomplishments, but I don't have any so I exclude it lol. 

## Resume

There's honestly so much to a resume, even at the intern level, that I think it deserves its own post. There are also tons of resources online that help you get started too, so I'd definitely recommend checking those out first, be sure to specify "engineering resumes" to get a better selection. [Here's an awesome one to start off.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JmdTN1bBOw&t) I'm going to assume you have most of the basics down like:
  
- Formatting
- Check spelling/grammar
- Use professional language 
- Use action verbs
- Highlight impact/accomplishments
- Use numbers to highlight impact
- Focus on your Strengths
- Use bullet points, not paragraphs
- Keep it one page
- Average time spent reading resume: six seconds
- If GPA above 3.0 or 3.5, list it, otherwise, leave it off
- Round up GPA within reason: 3.999 => 4.0

 I'll cover some of more tricks that you won't always find in your general "how to write a resume" video. Also keep in mind that I can only give so much general advice but after a point, I really need to see the resume to give good, specific feedback. 

If you know me irl, hit me up with your resume and I can review it for you. If you don't, well you're out of luck. jk feel free to send me your resumes for review, but no promises there. But if you're sending me your resume, you better have those basics and these tips here implemented in your resume because I don't want to waste my time giving basic feedback like "you mispelled this" when you should've got those on your own. 

Resumes are and should be very personalized and target your strengths. These general tips worked well for me and another disclaimer, implement these as you see fit to best highlight who you are. 

### Find Resumes you Like

It can be difficult to find creative ways to expand and improve your resume, especially after you feel that you've exhausted most of the advice out there. There's a good chance you didn't, so put that to the test by finding other resumes out there you like and improve your resume based off of those. I think this is a good way to get your resume off the ground and also further improve it from indirect input outside of your mindset. 

For starters, you could ask your friends for their resumes and do a comparison, but there's a good chance those resumes will be very similar to your's just based on many similarities and shared interests. Feel free to check out my resume as well for inspiration. If you're reading this on my personal site, you can find my resumes over in the "About" section on the main page. There aren't too many solid EE resumes floating around out there, so I would also suggest looking into the plethora of SWE resumes out there: 

- [Resumehub](https://www.careeers.org/): Student resumes, most of them are SWEs at top companies
- [Reddit r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions) [exemplary resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ioozqm/official_exemplary_resume_sharing_thread/) [sharing threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k90b9r/official_exemplary_resume_sharing_thread_december/): Users post resumes that have proven successful. Posts like these are posted every three months and at the time of writing this, there are only two threads, but that will continue to grow moving forward.

They actually look awfully similar to solid EE intern resumes, just replace CS with EE and you're good to go and don't put too much emphasis on languages/technologies for projects/experience. Actually there may be a few more things, but you get the main idea. 

### Include Projects!

Projects are also a great way to highlight soft/personal skills like your dedication, motivation, drive, and passion but also demonstrate that you have practical experience which often speaks louder than the standard set of EE courses every EE in the country takes. I'll go over way more about projects later on, but this section will target more on the resume side of things. 

Everything you put on your resume is an invitation for the interviewer to grill you on it, including your projects. Make sure you can actually talk about your projects: what you did, your design choices, collaboration efforts, etc. It might even look worse to an interviewer to have projects you can't talk about than having no projects at all. 

Feel free to put your school projects as well! I'm not sure how much project-based learning other schools have, but a cool class project I put on my resume is a RISC V core I built in my computer design class. Some class projects can be super practical like this one which may catch a hiring manager's eye, especially if they're looking for someone to help with CPU verification where that knowledge directly transfers over. Make sure you know the ins and out of that project though! Often times, many students BS their way through the project for a grade which ends up hurting them in the long run. Take advantage of the fact that you have experts like your professor and TAs to support you and make sure you understand the project very well.

On my resume, I like to briefly describe the project, including what it does and what features it has. Then, I mention what/how I built it. Depending on how much space, I go more in-depth on the project, targetting the content on the jobs I'm applying for. 

I also name my projects, some of them have their own names if they were hackathon submissions or products I designed, but others are just pure fun and I don't really have a name in mind. When this is the case, I just throw the word "epic" in front of what I built. For example, I'm designing a buck converter, so I call it "Epic Buck Converter" on my resume to make it sound at least 483x cooler. 

### Target Your Resumes

As usual, EE is a big field and one resume may be good for chip-level analog design in the semiconductor industry, but it may not fair as well for FPGA RTL roles. If you have the resume budget, it's typically recommended to target your resumes for specific roles, industries, and/or disciplines to maximize your fit. 

I typically don't individually tailor each and every resume I send out, that would be impractical for the 300+ applications I've sent out this season. I usually hand tailor for roles I'm really interested in, but every other role I apply to gets a "general tailored" resume. I have a general EE resume that I send out to general EE roles, but for roles that indicate a focus on power electronics, board design, or my other strengths get a resume dedicated to that. 

I have an "everything" resume that just has every single bullet point, project, and skill I can even put on a resume. If you're reading this on my blog, you can find my everything resume next to my other resumes in the About section on the home page. It ends up being pretty long, so I cut and trim points to tailor to a specific role/discipline. My customized resumes are just pre-cut versions of my everything resume. I tailor these resumes at the beginning of the application season but sort of leave it at that and don't really touch it again. I have like ten of these resumes that are all descendants of the 'everything' resume, so I make sure to double check that resume like 80 times to make sure it's all good. I don't want to have to individually tweak typos on ten resumes when I find an issue. 

If you don't have tons of resume budget, there are still tons of minor tweaks you can make. For example, my resumes for online applications have the education section on top, but my career fair resumes have education at the bottom because it's the career fair, the recruiter/hiring manager knows that it's Cal Poly and I typically indicate my major/year during my elevator pitch. 

I also use different fonts depending on my resume context. When reading a physical, paper copy, I use a font like Times New Roman because apparently studies show it's easier for people to read physically. For online resumes, I use Arial because those studies also show that fonts like Arial are easer to read on computers/screens. I'm not sure how much this actually matters and I stopped doing it because it got annoying given how many resume variants I maintain, but it's something I was taught in my tech writing class that may come in handy. 

If you're applying to opportunies in the US, unfortunately there's lots of bias agianst foreign-sounding names. This obviously shouldn't be the case, but often times it is and if you're getting frustrating results, try changing your name on your resume to a more "western" sounding name and you'd be surprised at the results. I hear of people changing their name on their resume to their more western "nickname" and getting way more callbacks and interviews. It's unfortunate but that's just how it is sometimes. 

### Resume Feedback

You should be continuously updating your resume, it's not a write-once-and-forget sort of thing. After an initial write/overhaul, proofreads, and a healthy amount of edits, share you resume with your friends, professors, your school's career services center, industry connections, and even online to get feedback. There's a good chance they have some opinions to share that you can take and implement as you see fit. 

When sharing your resume for review online by strangers, its obviously a good idea to censor out some private info. There are a ton of online communites to give and receive personalized resume feedback, like [r/EngineeringResumes](https://reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/) and [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kg3uv8/resume_advice_thread_december_19_2020/) [resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kdhljw/resume_advice_thread_december_15_2020/) [advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kbldm8/resume_advice_thread_december_12_2020/) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k73nru/resume_advice_thread_december_05_2020/) (keeping in mind that the latter is primarily focused for SWEs). People also post on their engineering subreddits for advice, but that isn't the primary purpose. 

I'd also recommend checking out [Resume Worded](https://resumeworded.com/), a super cool free site that uses AI to provide tailored feedback. 

### Real-World Feedback Loop

Ok now with your resumed reviewed and as solid as possible, it's time to put it out there. But even now, your resume still has room to improve and possibly the best feedback you can get is from those actually reviewing your resume and deciding how to proceed. There's obviously the easy way, directly ask your interviewers/recruiter on resume feedback, but this does't always work because most of the time, you get ghosted or rejected without ever seeing the anyone. I've sent out ~300 applications this season with only sixteen of these landing me interviews, that's a response rate of ~5%, only sixteen opportunies to actually get human feedback from the inside. 

Despite this, I can still use all of these rejections to continue to improve my resume. I play around with my resume, sending a few out and see how those fair. If I don't hear anything back after 50+ resumes, that points to an issue with my resume and I need to figure out what went wrong. This obviously isn't the best way to improve your resume, but it's certainly better than nothing. 

When you do get face-to-face (or zoom-to-zoom now) conversations with your hiring managers/recruiters, there are other ways to get valuable feedback without directly asking them. Notice where how your conversation evolves and what topics are being brought up, especially when in reference to your resume content. If over many interviews, your Arduino project gets brought up a lot, that may be a good sign to emphasize it more and de-emphasize other projects to dedicate more space for that Arduino project. If your that Arduino project comes up more often than your coding teacher job, that may also be a good sign to restructure your resume and put that Arduino project before the coding teacher job. 

Also notice what's not being mentioned. If no one talks about your robotics club from high school, that may be a good sign that it's not as significant as you thought it was. Your resume has very limited real estate and every line is extremely valueable so you want to pack as much as possible. 

But before you start gutting stuff out left and right, be sure to get a wide sample size to make sure your experience actually reflects what's out there. If most of your interviewers are on power electronics team, you might not get as much attention on your digital design projects. If you're shooting for power electronics roles, that may be a good sign to remove to re-evaluate that digital design project, but if you're just looking for general EE roles, leaving that digital project would probably be a good iea. 

In my experience, I noticed that my SWE internship wasn't being mentioned as much, it at all. This was expected, but I didn't anticipate that internship to get as little attention as it did. I actually went ahead and moved my EE internship to the top and cut down my SWE internship down to 2-3 lines to give more space for my EE internship to shine. There's also the general rule to put most recent experience at the top, but I've found great success bending that a bit in this situation. 

### Applicant Tracking System (ATS) Optimization

Many larger companies simply receive too many applications to read and manage each one, so they use Application Tracking Systems (ATS). ATS can parse your resume to look for keywords, for example, and see if you meet some sort of bar there. If you indicated that you're not a US citizen for a defense role, there's a good chance the ATS will auto-reject you. 

ATSs are necessary for big companies like Google and Apple who receive a few million applications every year for only a couple thousand spots, so it definitely makes sense to have that process be automated. ATSs may not be as much a concern with smaller companies, though I don't have too much legitimate data to back that up. I think some recruiting software like Lever do have some ATS capabilities and Lever is often used by smaller companies as well.

Most interns and even hiring managers aren't too involved on the ATS side of things, so my information on this won't be as thorough simply because I don't have much background on it. That being said, there still are ways to optimize your profile to best improve your chances through the ATS and get your resume in front of real eyes. The ATS or other computerized systems may filter out profiles and even reject them automatically without your profile ever seeing the light of day, so that's why it's critical to make sure your profile is ATS-ready.

The first thing I'd recommend is to avoid fancy formatting like tables and two-column layouts. These look really nice on paper to our eyes, but ATS don't have eyes and it can be difficult for them to parse through unusual text. 

Unfortunately, it's much more difficult to test how well your profile is received by an ATS, especially from the outside as an applicant. You can't ask the ATS 'hey! why'd you reject me?!'. Luckily, there are a few tools to help characterize how well a computer can analyze your resume. There's of course [Resume Worded](https://resumeworded.com/) and a few others like [cvlizer](https://www.joinvision.com/en/products/cvlizer/), but there aren't too many out there and I'm not sure how well they compare to what companies actually use. Alternatively, you can leverage job applications that auto-fill fields after uploading your resume like Workday and Taleo and see how those do. 

### Skills Section

A dedicated section to list your skills helps to pass the ATS's buzzword analysis and I'd recommend throwing adding this section into your resume. It's more applicable for engineering resumes and I see it very often on SWE resumes where it's important to highlight their languages, framworks, libraries, and technologies. For EE, it's not as important but it's still very helpful. 

A lot of the content in this section has come up again and again during interviews for me, it's one of those sections I continue to craft based on my recruiting experiences. I've been through a few interviews where my interviewer was asking me questions directly on the keywords I had under my skills section, I saw them circling and dotting right in that section lol. EE is a big field and many interviewers don't want to ask you stuff they know you don't know. Adding a "relevant coursework" list can help, but there are many common interview skills and topics that typically aren't covered in class so this skills section is a quick way to highlight some skills you have outside the classroom and demonstrate your strengths. 

When first starting out on this section, I like to divide up between HW and SW skills. I list good SW skills that crossover to HW like C, C++, Python, and Matlab. I try to keep it under one line because my resume is HW focused, SW skills are just the cherry on top. 

Then I list off my HW skills and topics I'm very comfortable with like I2C, SPI, UART, buck converters, motor drives, etc. If I see that many points can be catagorized into its own group, I do that. On my resume, I have a dedicate list for power electronics to include stuff like LiPo batteries, motor drives, buck converters, LDOs, etc. Most of the things I list here are more practical, but some good school material you can put include: controls, circuits, computer architecture, assembly, digital design, signal processing, MOSFETs, TTL/CMOS, transmision lines, etc. 

I typically don't add a dedication list for equipment/software, but I see it a few times. If you have experience with scopes, DMMs, VNAs, power supplies, etc. or Eagle, Cadence, Altium, Matlab, etc, it could be a good idea to list them. I actually found out recently that many schools don't have too much hands-on lab experience with this sort of equipment/software, so listing these could give you a leg up above those other students. 

Like everything else on your resume though, but sure to list things that you're comfortable with because this is basically a list of what the interview should grill you on. If you find that some items on your list are harder than expected, that's a good sign to remove it or review the material. 

Of course don't lie. Your "thermoquantum electromagenonized MUUGUFET circuits" might impress a clueless recruiter, but good luck talking about random nonsense with an engineer who actually knows what they're doing. One time when I was like ten, I saw my dad working on some resume/job stuff and noticed some random technical term and askin him what it was. He said he made it up to get past recruiters or something, but I still to this day don't know if he was serious about that or if he just didn't want to explain some technical stuff to a ten-year-old.

We're lucky that it's pretty easy to get hands-on experience through personal and class projects as an EE, especially when you have university resources like professors, TAs, labs, other motivated students, etc. It may not be as easy as CS, but it sure is much easier than say nuclear engineering or physics.

## Compensation

### Total Compensation (TC)
the total amount of money you're making, including stock, signing/starting bonuses, and other bonuses. These components can be more than 2x your 100k+ salary as a NG and continues to grow as you progress in your career, so salary typically isn't entirely reflective of how much you're actually making. Some industries are more salary-focused, others offer tons of other stocks and bonuses. TC typically refers to FTE comp, but it's also used to refer to intern comp because there are a few components that can make up a large portion of TC, including relocation/housing, transportation, and signing bonus. If you're lucky, a lot of this money can be directly pocketed. Typically doesn't include stuff liek 401k, insurance

# Common Misconceptions

- I NEED to be a junior to get an internship
- I NEED to match all the job requirements
- I'm only a freshman, there's nothing I can do
- I NEED internships to get internships
- I will start looking for internships in March
- Projects aren't important
- Applying online is useless
- The career fair is useless
- My uncle works at Google, he'll get me in
- I already have interviews, I can stop applying now
- You NEED to put your GPA, no matter how low it is

# Key Takeaways

If you've skipped everything, I guess here's a quick tl;dr of the main points

- Apply early
- Get started early
- Apply everywhere
- No experience is useless experience
- Stay determined! 

# Final Thoughts

Remember, landing an internship is tough. As of writing this, I've sent out 300+ applications and haven't even secured an offer yet. Sure, internships have tons of benefits, but it's not the end of the world of you don't land one. I know tons of people who didn't land internships in school and they're doing great now. Don't get discouraged and keep moving forward! Throughout the application process, even if you get rejected hundreds of times, you're still becoming an even stronger applicant. You'll develop a valuable skillset on navigating the application process that will be utilized again and again and no one can ever take that from you. 

# Appendix

- AFUNGALMASS - Yet another acronym for top tech companies: Amazon, Facebook, Uber, Netflix, Google, Apple, Lyft, Microsoft, AirBnB, Stripe, Snap. Techies are obsessed with "top companies" and "tiers" and try to cram more and more companies into the "top tier" by appending random letters to the end of FAANG like this: FAANGTLLAUMSDRDR (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, Twitter, Lyft, Linkedin, AirBnB, Uber, Microsoft, Snap, Datadog, Roblox, Doordash, Robinhood) and it's basically a meme, hence "a fungal mass". This is the term I use the most.
- ATS - Applicant Tracking System: Software implemented to track, filter, etc applicants.
- Big N - Another reference to the same top tech companies: Yes those techies need this many ways to refer to the same few companies. Big N is wider and more flexible in that the companies aren't "hardcoded" in a pronouncable acronym.
- CoL - Cost of Living: How expensive it is to live somewhere. High CoL includes SV/California, New York, etc. Lower CoL includes Wyoming, Arkansas, etc. TC is typically scaled with CoL. [Here's a nice website to characterize CoL.](https://www.bestplaces.net/)
- FAANG - Acronym for top tech companies: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google. This term originates from finance that captured the fastest growing stocks at the time and just found its way over to tech. It also represents other top-paying tech companies because no one wants to memorize a voltaile achronym that changes three times a day.
- FAANGMULAS - Another acronym for top tech companies: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Microsoft, Uber, Lyft, Stripe.
- FTE/FT - Full-Time Engineer/Full-Time
- HFT - High-Frequency Trading: The small industry that uses algorithms and software to make money by predicting the stock market. I use it synonomously with quant, hedge funds, and prop shops because I really don't know the difference. They're known to offer wicked salaries but are very competitive with limited seats because of the small industry size.
- HR - Human Resources: The part of a company that deals with recruiting and other people stuff.
- HWE - Hardware Engineer: Can refer to EEs or MEs and EEs, but I use it here to mean EE
- HYPSM - Acronym to refer to the top schools: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, MIT. Fun fact, it's pronounced "hip-sum".
- NG - New Grad: A recent grad/soon to graduate. The hiring process is typically handled by the same group of people that handle intern hiring, university relations (UR)
- SV - Silicon Valley: The geographical area around the San Francisco Bay Area in California. Home to a ton of tech companies and this area in general for other companies typically offers the highest TC to compensate for the expensive CoL.
- SWE - Software Engineer
- [TC - Total Compensation](https://www.levels.fyi/blog/what-is-total-compensation.html): The total amount of money you're making, including stock, signing/starting bonuses, relocation, and other bonuses.
- UR - Unveristy Relations: A dedicated division of HR to handle the recruiting of NGs and interns. At big companies, there are dedicated teams separate from experienced/industry hires, but at smaller companies, this may not be the case. 
- YoE - Years of Experience: Typically doesn't include internships, masters or PhD's may get 1-2 extra years
