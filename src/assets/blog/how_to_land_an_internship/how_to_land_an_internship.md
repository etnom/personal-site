Do a quick Google search for ["how to get a software engineering internship"](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=how+to+get+a+software+engineering+internship) and ["how to get an electrical engineering internship"](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=how+to+get+an+electrical+engineering+internship). The software engineers (SWE) get tons of online resources, blog posts, communites, etc. detailing every step of the process, all the tricks of the trade while we get next to nothing. Well not anymore! This EPIC guide will put all those SWE write-ups to shame and share basically everything I know about landing internships based off of my experiences landing offers at Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft, etc. through 100+ inteviews and 500+ applications.

# Disclaimers

By existing, you agree to donate 90% of your lifetime earnings to me for all eternity throughout the universe until the end of time. Just kidding, but there are a few nuances that I want to address because EE is a very broad field and everyone's situation will be different. Be sure to keep these in mind when reading this guide.

## My Experience

First of all, this post will be based off of my experience, so there's going to be tons of inherit biases there. Most of my experience is at big tech companies, so if you're also shooting for those, well you're in luck. If not, be sure to keep that in the back of your mind when reading this. For example, when I go over projects and you're looking to get into the power industry, that might not be as applicable to you. 

Additionally, I'm based in the US and I'm working on my undergrad in California near Silicon Valley. International students may have a different process for internships in their country and there are many more hoops to jump through to land an internship in the US. Grad students may also have a different experience, especially if you're applying for lab- or research-based positions.

That being said, most of this advice will be highly applicable to you, no matter what industry you're going into, but obviously some more than others. Some of my advice around resume-writing and interviews for example extend beyond EE. Just like everything you read on the internet, take this with a grain of salt and remain thoughful of what you want to implement and what you want to ignore.

## Don't Compare Yourself to Others

If you hit all of these points throught the entire post, you're in *very* good shape. But if not, don't feel discouraged or that "I'm not good enough". You wanna hear a secret? There are a ton of points here that I don't even hit. This guide is sort of the 'light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel' thing, an ideal to strive towards. Identify what you're missing and use this guide to build your skills and become a killer applicant.

So don't feel discouraged that you're not in the 99.999999th percentile of EE students implementing each and every one of these points to their absolute perfection. There's only one thing you should compare yourself to and that's yourself from yesterday, not some random post on the internet from some random internet stranger. 

You're going to see your classmates and friends landing internships left and right, and again, don't compare yourself to them. I get it, we're in college and we always compare ourselves to others and stuff. But at the end of the day, remember there's only one person you should compare yourself to and that's yourself from yesterday. And if your friends and classmates are landing amazing internships, that's great! Go leech off them LOL. 

Anyways enough of the fine print let's get going to the real stuff!

## Similarities to SWE

I will be drawing many comparisons to the SWE process because their processes are very similar to our's, but they just have way more resources. For the longest time, I actually had my career set on being a SWE and I still remain quite active in the SWE communities. If you want more tips and stuff, you could also read up on those SWE posts and 95% of their information will be directly applicable to you as an EE, especially if you're looking to get into tech. I will point out many of the key differences throughout this post as they come up so you get a good idea of what to ignore and what to take in. 

Alternatively, if you find out that you actually want to go into SWE as a result of this post, well more power to you! That's even a win for me since SWEs get paid more, so my 90% cut of your compensation (that you agreed to by existing) will continue to grow.
